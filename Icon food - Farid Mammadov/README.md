# Icon Food - E-commerce

"Icon Food" is my final project in the Front End course, and it represents an e-commerce website developed using React. The project adopts a mobile-first development approach, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience across various devices.

In the design phase, I meticulously crafted the user interface and layout using Figma, a design tool, to create an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive shopping platform. The result is a visually appealing and user-centric e-commerce website.

To build this project, I adopted a modular approach by dividing the pages into reusable components. This structure enhances maintainability and allows for easy updates and additions in the future. Key components such as the header, footer, buttons, and product cards were meticulously designed and implemented to provide a seamless and consistent user experience.

For navigation, I employed routing to ensure smooth transitions between different sections of the website. This enables users to browse products, view details, and make purchases effortlessly. Additionally, I implemented sorting and filtering features to enhance the user's ability to find specific items and streamline their shopping journey. Sorting options and filters help users find the products they desire quickly and efficiently.

"Icon Food" is not just a final project; it is a showcase of my skills in front-end development and user interface design. It exemplifies the principles of responsive design, modular architecture, and a user-centered approach. This project represents a significant milestone in my journey as a web developer, and I am excited to share it with the world.
