This project was developed as part of the Front-End Web Development program I completed at Tech Academy in 2023. Using React as the framework, the project was a collaborative effort, with each student taking responsibility for different pages and features. For the back-end, I integrated Strapi to manage content seamlessly. The result is an innovative online sales platform that showcases our collective work and skills in building modern web applications.
